# Global-Health-Demographic-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of global health data, focusing on comorbidities, death rates, and other key demographic factors across countries worldwide.
Overview
This project uses a dataset of raw data on global comorbidities and death rates. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the relationships between various factors, such as:
1. Comorbidities like diabetes prevalence and cardiovascular death rates
2. Total deaths and their distribution across countries and regions
3. Demographic factors such as the percentage of the population aged 70 or older
4. Vaccination rates and their correlation with population size

All analysis and visualizations were conducted using Python in a Google Colab environment.
